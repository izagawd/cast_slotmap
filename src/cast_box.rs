/// A stored value that knows the concrete [`TypeId`] of what it owns.

/// This is the extension point for [`CastMapG`](crate::cast_map::CastMapG):
/// its checked lookups read it to validate a key's type. The crate implements
/// it for [`CastBox`], but it is deliberately a public, box-level trait — to
/// use your own owning box with the checked maps, implement `ConcreteTypeId`
/// for it (alongside `Deref` + [`StableDeref`], which any stored pointer
/// needs). Nothing here assumes `CastBox` specifically.
///
/// Why store the id instead of asking the value? Not every store answers
/// correctly: `Box<dyn Any>` could, but for a `Box<dyn Foo>` where `Foo` is
/// not an `Any` subtrait, `type_id` resolves statically to
/// `TypeId::of::<dyn Foo>()` — not the underlying type's — and
/// special-casing the stores that answer correctly would make the checked
/// maps' behavior depend confusingly on the store's type. An
/// explicitly stored id works uniformly — and is also a performance win: a
/// plain field read per lookup instead of a virtual call to ask the value.
///
/// # Safety
/// The checked maps rebuild typed references based on this value:
/// `concrete_type_id` must return the [`TypeId`] of the concrete type of the
/// value this box currently owns. A wrong answer lets a safe lookup
/// reinterpret the value as another type, which is undefined behavior.
